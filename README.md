# ST-SMS-Backend using Django REST API (sample backend for portfolio purpose, for main repo, please see [ST-SMS-BACKEND](https://github.com/0x5929/ST-SMS-BACKEND)

Django REST Framework for Select Therapy Institute Student Management System. (Backend UI)[https://0x5929.pythonanywhere.com/auth/login/], please DM project owner for credentials.

Remember that if any new changes to the old repo, also needs to be applied here. Since this is not a fork, nor branch, we cannot pull request and merge/sync the two codebases

**To clone the repo for dev purpose, please do the following (with empty database, sometime down the line, I will also export the db data file to be imported):**

## Requirements:

1. Python Version 3.9.6
2. Postgresql Version 12

7. Start pgadmin4 and connect to localhost:5432 where postgresql-12 is running, add a new database named **dev** (if database file available, skip adding the database dev and just import .sql file instead)

```Bash
# change auth method from ident to md5

# Accept from anywhere on port 5432
host all all 0.0.0.0/0 md5

```

8. `$ sudo systemctl restart postgresql-12`

#### **Download and install postgresql12 and management software [Win Installer](https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgresql-tutorial-resources-training?cid=48)**

#### **Download and install postgresql12 and management software [Mac Installer](https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgresql-tutorial-resources-training?cid=47)**

15. Once installed, please log into pgadmin4, and create database name: dev

### **Clone from Github**

1. `$ cd ~/ && mkdir ST-SMS && cd ST-SMS`
2. `$ git clone https://github.com/0x5929/ST-SMS-Backend.git`

_Note:_ If having trouble to pull/clone, please see : [clone using personal token](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68775869/support-for-password-authentication-was-removed-please-use-a-personal-access-to)

---

### **Start virtual environment and install dependencies**

1. `$ cd ST-SMS-Backend`
2. `$ python3.9 -m venv virtual-env`
3. `$ source virtual-env/bin/activate`
4. `$ pip -V` (should output 3.9)
5. `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

_Note:_ If having trouble to install postgres db connector, try: `$ PATH="<postgres-installation-path>/bin/:$PATH" pip install -r requirements.txt`

## for my fedora system, the path is : `/usr/pgsql-12/bin/`

### **Add in the st-sms-creds.json file**

1. This file is used for Google API access, needs to be there or SMS endpoints will fail
2. This file is only stored locally in repo owner's drive, for security reasons
3. For a new project, one can create such file by following the first eight steps in this [guide](https://robocorp.com/docs/development-guide/google-sheets/interacting-with-google-sheets)
4. _Explanation_ To elaborate on point 1, this file is used to access Google API, more specifically to mirror data from postgres db to Google Sheets (For school, BPPE compliance reasons)

### **Edit `core/settings/.env-template` file**

1. Using your fav text editor to edit `/ST-SMS-Backend/core/settings/.env-template` file
2. Rename the file to `.<dev|test|prod>-env` so it can be picked up by django

- In dev environment, `manage.py` picks up the settings config
- In prod environment, `wgsi.py` or `agsi.py` will point towards the setting file desired.

_Note:_ To generate a new secret key: `$ python manage.py shell`

```Python

>>> from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
>>> a = get_random_secret_key()
>>> a
>>> a
'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
>>>
```

### **Migrate and add superuser; then start server (If starting with a blank Database)**

1. `$ python manage.py makemigrations --dry-run`
2. `$ python manage.py makemigrations`
3. `$ python manage.py migrate`
4. `$ python manage.py createsuperuser`
5. `$ python manage.py loaddata fixtures/all-inital-data.json`
6. `$ python manage.py runserver`

_Note:_ If encountered errors where library images not found. You may need to symbolic link libraries from `/postgresql/installation/path/lib/<lib-missing>` to `/usr/local/lib`. More info, see: [psycopg2-image-not-found](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16407995/psycopg2-image-not-found)

---

### **Import existing data from Google Sheets**

1. dump data from google using by calling the following API (needs to have superuser access)

- `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d "{\"email\": \"root@localhost\", \"password\": \"you-password\"}" http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/login/`

- Remember to add the authentication token from the response in the next request
- `curl -H "Authorization Bearer {access_token}" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/sms/google_sheet_datadump/?ssid=<spreadsheet id>&sid=<sheet id>&school_name=<school name value, ie: STI>`

2. Save the JSON response into a file
3. `$ python manage.py loaddata <dump-file.json>`
4. `$ python manage.py makemigrations --dry-run` under normal circumstances, there are no migration changes

**note that these steps should be done in both dev and prod environments to have a ready Database**

---

_If server started in dev by `$ python manage.py runserver`, it will live on http://localhost:8000_

_If server started in prod, make sure check `wsgi.py` file so it points to prod settings, refer to hosting agent._

### **CI/CD workflow with pythonanywhere**

- Once there is a push action to the origin main (this) branch, it will trigger webhook
  - webhook will call an endpoint https://api.domain.com/git_pull_main/
    - this webhook is protected by github IP, and its webhook secret
- webhook will do a git pull action
- git pull will trigger a git hook (post-merge) inside the production server's `.git/hooks` directory

  - remember that every pull action will include merge, so this hook is valid.
  - post-merge hook will re-touch the `wsgi.py` file (the server's file) ie `/var/www/username_appname_wsgi.py`
  - post-merge hook will have at least user permission to execute!
  - sample `post-merge`:

  ```sh

  #!/bin/sh

  touch <server-wsgi-file>.py


  ```

  `chmod u+x post-merge`
